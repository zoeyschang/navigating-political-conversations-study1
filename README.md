# navigating-political-conversations-study1
For our CS366 final research project, we used the OpenAI Javascript node.js code to generate user personas for our Study 1.

To use the study1.js file, put your own OpenAI API key in place of the comment "put your API key here" to initialize the variable 'openai'. Each user has a unique, secret OpenAI key that cannot be shared.
