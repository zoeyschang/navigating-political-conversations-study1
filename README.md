# navigating-political-conversations-study1
For our CS366 final research project, we used the OpenAI Javascript node.js package and OpenAI API to generate user personas for our Study 1 as part of a three-part study. 

To use the study1.js file, put your own OpenAI API key in place of the comment "insert your own OpenAI API key here" to initialize the variable 'openai'. Each user has a unique, secret OpenAI key that cannot be shared.
